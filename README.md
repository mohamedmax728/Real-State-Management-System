· Employee can do:
1- View all assigned flats.
2-Update the description of the flats.
3-Check case status and update any important info as and when
needed.
4- View all information about involved people in the past crimes
(the crimes of the same types or in the same area).1

· Customer can do:
1-add an ads for his own flat.
2-View all available flats.
3-add specific flats in favorite list/ view the favorite list.
4-confirm buying or rental the flat.
5-Rate the employee.
6-Add a review to a specific the flat/ view all reviews to a specific
flat.

· System should do
1-Based on the location of the customer the system will
recommend flats by the location.

3-The system include a financial section that calculates – for example –
the company’s commission after selling a flat/house, and generates
invoices.
